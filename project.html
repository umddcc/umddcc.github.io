          <div class="one">
            <p class="para1">We partnered with SCUA, the Special Collections & University Archives at UMD, to create a project for you to learn more about the Brooke Family. Today you can read the Brooke Family daybooks in person in the Hornbake Library at the University of Maryland College Park. In order to read them, you need to request for the daybooks on the SCUA website. Anyone is welcome to read these daybooks and the members of SCUA are happy to answer any questions you may have.
              <br>
              <br>
              We invite you to take part in the transcription of the Brooke Family papers, a unique collection of documents that contains valuable information about the Brooke family. The Brooke Family papers consist of a collection of diaries, which were created by several women in the Brooke Family. They address topics of religion, motherhood, housework, education, social gatherings, farm life, and more. Other materials in the Brooke family archive that are not included in this first set of documents on FromThePage include scrapbooks, photographs, memorabilia, business records, travel journals, sketches, poetry, printed ephemera, and oral history transcripts. What you will be transcribing are daybooks. We hope that by helping to transcribe these daybooks, you gain insight into the rich culture and life of the Brooke Family, and more broadly, what it means to be a Quaker in the 1800-1900s.</p>

            <p class="para2">We created this project to help other fellow students,
              transcribers, and general citizens who are interested in the history of Maryland to have access to antique
              pieces unique to the University of Maryland. We believe that transcribing is a great way to understand the
              lifestyle of the Brooke Family. Itâ€™s a great way to compare our modern day lives to the past, and really
              just gain a better understanding of what life was like centuries ago from a first hand experience. To
              check out more about Quakers, the Brooke Family, and SCUA, click the button to see our project and start
              transcribing!</p>
