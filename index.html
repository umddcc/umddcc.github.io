        <hr class="landline">
        <p class="landp">Every community owes its existence and vitality to generations from around the world who contribute their hopes, dreams, and energy to their society. Some were brought here against their will, some were drawn to leave their distant homes in hope of a better life, and some have lived on the land where UMD College Park stands for more generations than can be counted.
          <br><br>
UMD stands on the ancestral lands of the Piscataway People, who were among the first in the Western Hemisphere to encounter European colonists. We pay respects to their elders past and present. Please take a moment to consider the many legacies of violence, displacement, migration, and settlement that bring us together as a university community, and the opportunities to learn about and acknowledge the complex forces that govern all our lives.
