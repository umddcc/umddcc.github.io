      <hr class="line">
      <p class="crowdsourcing"><em>"Crowdsourcing draws on the collective knowledge, generosity and skills of diverse people.
This semester you will learn about crowdsourcing methodologies for ethical project design and engagement,
and specifically how to build a transcription project using a tool called From the Page. Crowdsourcing and the
data it produces are increasingly vital parts of the information landscape.
<br>
<br>
Crowdsourcing enables us to conduct
research at a pace and with a degree of visibility and inclusivity that is unprecedented. Folks anywhere with an
internet connection can take part, and with care and attention from crowdsourcing project makers, volunteer
communities can develop their research interests in parallel with the project goals. Crowdsourcing is used by
journalists, cultural heritage practitioners, STEM and humanities scholars across the spectrum to answer some
of our most pressing research questions."

      <p class="crowdsourcing2"> <em>"Every community owes its existence and vitality to generations from around the world who contribute their hopes,
  dreams, and energy to their society. Some were brought here against their will, some were drawn to leave their
  distant homes in hope of a better life, and some have lived on the land where UMD College Park stands for more
  generations than can be counted.
  <br>
  <br>
  UMD stands on the ancestral lands of the Piscataway People, who were among the first in the Western Hemisphere
  to encounter European colonists. We pay respects to their elders past and present. Please take a moment to consider
  the many legacies of violence, displacement, migration, and settlement that bring us together as a university community,
  and the opportunities to learn about and acknowledge the complex forces that govern all our lives."

      <div class="one">
        <p class="p1">We partner with SCUA, the Special Collections & University Archives at UMD, to create a project for you to learn more about the Brooke Family. Today you can read the Brooke Family daybooks in person in the Hornbake Library at the University of Maryland College Park. In order to read them, you need to request for the daybooks on the SCUA website. Anyone is welcome to read these daybooks and the members of SCUA are happy to answer any questions you may have.
<br>
<br>
We invite you to take part in the transcription of the Brooke Family papers, a unique collection of documents that contains valuable information about the Brooke family. The Brooke Family papers consist of a collection of diaries, which were created by several women in the Brooke Family. They address topics of religion, motherhood, housework, education, social gatherings, farm life, and more. Other materials in the Brooke family archive that are not included in this first set of documents on FromThePage include scrapbooks, photographs, memorabilia, business records, travel journals, sketches, poetry, printed ephemera, and oral history transcripts. What you will be transcribing are daybooks. We hope that by helping to transcribe these daybooks, you gain insight into the rich culture and life of the Brooke Family, and more broadly, what it means to be a Quaker in the 1800-1900s.

      <p class="p2">We created this project to help other fellow students,
transcribers, and general citizens who are interested in the history of Maryland to have access to antique
pieces unique to the University of Maryland. We believe that transcribing is a great way to understand the
lifestyle of the Brooke Family. Itâ€™s a great way to compare our modern day lives to the past, and really
just gain a better understanding of what life was like centuries ago from a first hand experience. To
check out more about Quakers, the Brooke Family, and SCUA, click the button to see our project and start
transcribing!</p>
